## Popler Overview
Popler is a centralized database for population dynamics datasets gathered throughout 
NSF's Long Term Ecological Resarch (LTER) stations. 

We define population dynamics datasets as follows:

- Time series data of a randomly sampled population measuring changes in abundance, 
density, biomass, cover class or individual measures on a temporally regular 
interval over a standardized set of spatial units and sampling effort. 
The interval of time must encompass the life cycle of the organism such that 
birth and deaths occur during the interval.

### Temporal Referencing
All temporal information within a dataset is stored using exact 
sampling dates up to the day resolution, when available. Since not all datasets 
have the same temporal resolution Popler stores date time information in three 
separate columns; **day, month, and year**. In any of the date time columns, 
`NULL`  or `-99999` values indicate that the information was not available 
from the raw data. 

**Never do we perform any temporal aggregations of data prior to storing them in Popler.**

### Spatial Referencing
We have chosen to reference sampling locations (spatial levels) by the unit of replication 
a sample represents in an experimental design. 

For example, a study performed at 5 sites, with 3 transects at each site, and 4 
quadrats within each transect is referenced as having 3 levels of spatial 
replication:

- Level 1: the site level, 
- Level 2: the transect level
- Level 3: the quadrat level

This referencing scheme allows us to standardize and align datasets collected 
from a variety of different sampling designs and across different data types. 

Metadata related to the extent of a spatial sampling unit is recorded when 
available (i.e. km2, m2, cm2, etc.). Note, higher levels of spatial replication 
indicate smaller areas of sampling extent. 


**Never do we aggregate data by levels of spatial replication prior to storing them in Popler.**

#### Spatial Replication Level 1
By referencing sampling locations in the above manner a ‘site’ label within a dataset
represent the highest level of spatial replication (level 1).  With permanent 'sites' 
existing at LTER stations and reused across studies, ‘site’ lables 
allow querying of data collected for particular spatial locations regardless of the 
original study a dataset was derived from.

When possible, latitude and longitude coordinates are also recorded if available in 
the source metadata; -99999 values exist within these fields for studies that do not 
record geographic location for their 'site' label. 


## The Popler Database Schema

The following depicts the relationship structure among 14 tables. Below we will
discuss this schema, table contents, and give definitions. Three
tables will not be discussed as two are climate related data tables yet to be populated
and one is a table for database migration information.

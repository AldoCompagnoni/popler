Updates included in this version

* Updated Roxygen documentation to include all dependencies and updated NAMESPACE accordinly

* updated `alt icon` folder name to `alt_icon` to make it more portable

* Edited buildignore to include some files that don't need to be made available in package

* Added a couple options to default devtools::check/R CMD check settings so life is a bit easier in the pre-CRAN submission era

* Moved the `explanations` and `explain_short` objects into an internally stored list called `R/sysdata.rda` to fix some NOTES from devtools::check().
